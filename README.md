# Welcome to #LearningLabs!

A project designed to provide safe and useful information at the same time, where it is possible to find topics of cyber security, programming, engineering, electronics and of course life. Our idea is open source, in fact in this repository you can find all the code related to our project.
You can participate in the development, report bugs and help us keep the portal always at the cutting edge. We are an Italian team, but we love to surround ourselves with people of all nationalities


# The Project

Below you will find specific information, as nerds to be clear, about the project;
 The enviroments we use, the programming languages we use to write our project and the open source libraries on which we rely

## The FrontEnd Enviroment

We love JavaScript, TypeScript and other languages, that's why we choose one of the most famous and important platforms, **[Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular)**!!
Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications using Typescript/JavaScript and other languages.


## The BackEnd Enviroment


The part relating to the backend is slightly more articulated. Is divided into two parts, a database service, NoSQL, and a rest API service that uses Express and Node.js:

- **The Rest API Service** it's based on [**Node.js**](https://github.com/nodejs/node) and **[Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)**
	> More informations will be added soon.

- **The Database Service** it's based on **[MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)**
	> MongoDB **stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents**, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time

## The Dedicated Servers System

Our dedicated servers work thanks to a very important project, **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**, which allows container virtualization and their distribution on a redundant and decentralized system
